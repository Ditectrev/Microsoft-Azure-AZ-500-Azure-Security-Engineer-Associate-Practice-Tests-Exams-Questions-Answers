### You need to deploy AKS1 to meet the platform protection requirements. Which four actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order. NOTE: More than one order of answer choices is correct. You will receive credit for any of the correct orders you select. Explanation:Scenario: Azure AD users must be to authenticate to AKS1 by using their Azure AD credentials. Litewire plans to deploy AKS1, which is a managed AKS (Azure Kubernetes Services) cluster. Step 1: Create a server application To provide Azure AD authentication for an AKS cluster, two Azure AD applications arecreated. The first application is a server component that provides user authentication. Step 2: Create a client application The second application is a client component that's used when you're prompted by the CLI for authentication. This client application uses the server application for the actual authentication of the credentials pr vided by the client. Step 3: Deploy an AKS cluster. Use the az group create command to create a resource group for the AKS cluster. Use the az aks create command to deploy the AKS cluster. Step 4: Create an RBAC binding. Before you use an Azure Active Directory account with an AKS cluster, you must create role-binding or cluster role-binding. Roles define the permissions to grant, and bindings apply them to desired users. These assignments can be applied to a given namespace, or across the entire cluster
